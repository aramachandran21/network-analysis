The code shared here is basically to viualize the outcome  of the travel made across various states of the US interactively.
I have used the below applications/packages(not an exhaustive list) and have embedded them all into a wrapper python script.

1. Networkx- to calculate the degree centrality and other metrics of social network analysis.
2. bokeh- for the rendition of the graph in html format that covers all the interactive aspects
3. basemap- to render the US geographical map embedded into the html.
4. geolocator- to fetch the latitude and longitude of the states

and so on …
